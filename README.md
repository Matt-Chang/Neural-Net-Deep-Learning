# Deep_Learning_Projects

I put all my  Deep_Learning Projects in this file.



## ðŸ”— I categorized them by each different purpose:

[![01-Neural-Net-Deep-Learning -](https://img.shields.io/badge/project-01__Keras%20Syntax%20Basics-red)](https://github.com/Matt-Chang/Neural-Net-Deep-Learning/blob/main/01_Keras%20Syntax%20Basics.ipynb)

In this project, I used TensorFlow 2.0 , Keras, as the main API choice. I will go through a simple regression project to understand the basics of the Keras syntax and adding layers.


[![02_Keras Regression Project](https://img.shields.io/badge/project-02__Keras%20Regression%20Project-red)](https://github.com/Matt-Chang/Neural-Net-Deep-Learning/blob/main/02_Keras%20Regression%20Project%20.ipynb)

In this project, I used the dataset, housesalesprice, from Kaggle to showcase my understanding in Keras Regression. 


[![02-2 Keras TF 2.0 - Classification Project](https://img.shields.io/badge/project-02--2%20Keras%20TF%202.0%20--%20Classification%20Project-red)](https://github.com/Matt-Chang/Neural-Net-Deep-Learning/blob/main/02-2%20Keras%20TF%202.0%20-%20Classification%20Project.ipynb)

In this project, I used the dataset, Breast cancer wisconsin (diagnostic), to better implement Keras for my study. 


[![03-Keras-Big_Project - API Project Exercise](https://img.shields.io/badge/project-03--Keras--Big__Project-red)](https://github.com/Matt-Chang/Neural-Net-Deep-Learning/blob/main/03-Keras-Big_Project.ipynb)

Project purpose :

Given historical data on loans given out with information on whether or not the borrower defaulted (charge-off), can ï¼© build a model that can predict wether or nor a borrower will pay back their loan? This way in the future when we get a new potential customer we can assess whether or not they are likely to pay back the loan.
